## My Expertise

-   Web Development
    -   In about 9 years, I have produced both corporate and individual internet projects, hundreds of advertising campaigns, modules and code blocks. With my front-end development-oriented studies, I have improved myself in both coding technologies and design studies. In my work on the backend, I am trying to improve myself in developing api with crud operations. As a database, I have worked with both mysql and mongodb, large and small.
-   Project Management
    -   Especially when I was working in the advertising industry, I produced advertising projects for almost all companies in the country. I took part in the infrastructure, design and projects of user-interactive dynamic ads through premium ads with different models on different websites. Apart from this work, I gave project development support to many companies as a freelancer.
-   Content Creation
    -   In addition to my work on content production on platforms such as youtube, twitch and spotify, I have 3 blog sites of my own. On these sites, I produce content on software and technology, healthy lifestyle and content production, and personal things. I do the subjects, content, video shooting and editing of the content I produce on all platforms.
